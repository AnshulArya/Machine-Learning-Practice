# Hospital Readmission Prediction Using Machine-Learning
To predict whether a patient will readmit within 30 days

As the healthcare system moves toward value-based care, CMS has created many programs to improve the quality of care of patients. One of these programs is called the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), which reduces reimbursement to hospitals with above average readmissions. For those hospitals which are currently penalized under this program, one solution is to create interventions to provide additional assistance to patients with increased risk of readmission. But how do we identify these patients? We can use predictive modeling from data science to help prioritize patients.
